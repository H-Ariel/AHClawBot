	"bosses": {
		"Le Rauxe": "Captain Spot Le Rauxe is the boss for level 2. Although Le Rauxe doesn't have a projectile attack, he is an expert swordsman, capable of carving up Claw if given the chance. Le Rauxe is a sniveling, whining dog, but is quite an adversary. He can also block Claw's projectile attacks, sustaining only partial damage from them.\nLe Rauxe also charges Claw, moving quickly away from his attacks.",
		"Katherine": "Katherine (Leader of the Thieves) is the boss for Level 4. She has 2 attacks\u05d2\u20ac\u201da whip, which is used for long-distance attacks, and a dagger stab, which happens at close distances. This boss should be fast and agile, hitting CC quickly and often.\nKatherine was once a member of Claw's crew. Claw banished her from his ship because of her recklessness.",
		"Wolvington": "Magistrate Wolvington (Captain of the Guard) is the boss for Level 6. Wolvington is the leader of the town. He is an excellent swordsman and is the toughest enemy that CC has faced up to this point. He has 2 kinds of attacks. The first is a sword attack, which is basically a normal sword swipe/stab. The 2nd is his gauntlet punch, which is a special attack that, if successful, will knock Claw off his feet and do a lot of damage.",
		"Gabriel": "Mr. Gabriel (Red Tail's First Officer) is the boss for Level 8. Gabriel stands on the bow of a ship and commands his men. He throws bombs at Claw. In order for Claw to defeat Gabriel, he must jump onto several moving pegs and attack him directly. If Claw falls off the pegs, the enemies below will attack him.",
		"Marrow": "Captain Joseph Marrow is the boss for Level 10. Marrow and Claw have known each other for some time, and are considered rivals. Marrow has a parrot that sits on his shoulder and attacks Claw.",

	},
	"enemies": {
		"Rat": "The rat is the first of several \"beasties\" that Claw meets during his adventures. Although the rat has few hit points, he does considerable damage and is high on the \"annoyance\" meter.\nThe rat can be placed in small areas, between ledges, etc.\nThe Punk-Rat (at level 2) controls cannons. Killing this rat will stop the cannon from firing. The rat stands on top of the cannon, then lights the cannon w/a punk.",
		"Soldier": "This Soldier is a \"human\" style enemy in level 1. The Soldier has fewer hit points than the Officer, and isn't as smart. However, the Soldier does have a rifle attack (both high and low), which should prove quite difficult for Claw.\nThe Level 2 Soldier is based on Level 1 Soldier, but is painted differently and is more difficult.",
		"Officer": "The officer is the highest ranking enemy in level 1. The officer is smarter than the soldier, but lacks a projectile attack. The officer will actively approach Claw if activated. The Officer also avoids Claw's attacks by jumping backwards.\nThe Level 2 Officer is a repainted and more difficult version of the level 1 Officer. These officers are the highest ranking enemy in level 2, except for Le Rauxe. Note that this officer has a yellow plume and black sash, which are different than the level 1 officer.",
		"Robber Thief": "The RobberThief is a sneaky enemy, firing bolts from his crossbow. The Robberthief can fire at mid-level and from a ducking position.\nThe Robber Thief is a projectile-only enemy, which means that he's less effective at close quarters.",
		"Cutthroat": "The Cutthroat has 2 attacks: a knife throw and a knife stab. The throw comes at 2 levels, high and low. The stab is a single attack of 2 knife stabs at 1 level.\nThe Cutthroat is the most difficult non-boss enemy that Claw has faced up to this point.",
		"Seagull": "The seagull will attack claw from the air (dive bomb attack).",
		"Town Guard": "The Town Guards defend the Town. They act in an orderly manner, attacking in numbers.\nTown Guard #1 is the lesser of the two town guards. These town guards can block Claw's sword attacks 25% of the time.\nTown Guard #2 is the greater of the two town guards. These town guards can block Claw's sword attacks 75% of the time.",
		"Hermit Crab": "The Hermit Crab can attack Claw with his claws, or he can throw a projectile at Claw. The Hermit Crab can only be killed: 1) when he's out of his shell (by pistol, sword or magic attack), or 2) if he's picked up and thrown by Claw, or 3) he's knocked off a platform by Claw.\nWhen the Hermit Crab is in his shell, Claw can \"bump\" him around.",

		"MerCat": "The MerCat w/Trident has 2 attacks: he can stab with his trident, or he can do a \"magic\" trident attack (a projectile comes out of the trident). The animators can use the same animation for the stab and the projectile. The mercat can \"swim\", i.e., he can use his tail to support himself while in the water. The mercat can also \"walk\" on land by using his tail to slide around. Being able to exist in both water and land makes this enemy very flexible and dangerous.",
		"Siren": "The Cat Mermaid (Siren) makes a siren call that acts as a projectile. If Claw gets hit by this attack (a moving \"cone\" of sound), it puts Claw under a spell. While under the spell, Claw can't move. This attack won't cause Claw any damage, but it will place him in a very vulnerable position to get hit by other enemies. She also has lower health than other enemies.",
		"Fish": "These fish jump out of the water and attack Claw.",
		"Chameleon": "The chameleon will fade in and out of the background, making him a very difficult enemy to kill.",
		"Tiger Guard": "The Tiger Guard is very difficult and fast - the most challenging lower level enemy faced to this point"

	"story": "Loved by many...feared by all. Captain Claw, surveyor of the 7 seas, is perhaps the greatest pirate ever to grace the Animalian Lore Realms. His courage? Legendary. His followers? Loyal to the death. His claws? Well, let's just say that more than a few sailors have permanent reminders of their razor-sharp tips.\n\nSeveral years ago a proclamation, signed by the King, was issued to the realm. This proclamation read:\n\nFor numerous crimes against the Realm, and for the repeated destruction and theft of the property of the Cocker Spaniard Kingdom, and for a complete and utter disregard for the authority of the Crown, a bounty in the amount of 1,000,000 gold pieces is hereby issued for the capture, dead or alive, of Captain Nathaniel J. Claw, dreaded pirate, enemy of the Realm, and known scallywag.\n\nBecause of this proclamation, every bounty hunter and magistrate in the Realm has sought to capture the elusive Captain Claw. Many have tried to capture this infamous pirate, but none have succeeded\u05d2\u20ac\u201duntil now. Claw's ship is overtaken on the high-seas by Captain Le Rauxe, a high-ranking officer in the King's service and a pompous and unscrupulous dog. Subsequently, Claw's ship is scuttled, and Claw and his crew are captured and taken to La Roca, a prison run by the Cocker Spaniards. While imprisoned Claw discovers a letter written by Edward Tobin, a former prisoner executed for crimes against the Crown. Tobin's letter tells of the existence of the Amulet of Nine Lives - a mystical amulet that, according to myth, provides the wearer with near immortality. With his strength and hope renewed by the promise of adventure, Claw breaks out of his prison cell and begins a quest to reclaim his crew and locate the remaining gems for the Amulet of Nine Lives. With a million \"golden\" reasons to separate Claw from his head, every servant of the Realm will be out to stop Claw from completing his quest. If he fights skillfully, Claw may avoid death and uncover the remaining gems for the Amulet of Nine Lives. With enough luck, ultimately Claw may complete his quest and reassemble the powerful Amulet of Nine Lives."
